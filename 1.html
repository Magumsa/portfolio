  <h1>Bauhaus 역사</h1>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.naver.com/"target="_blank" title="네이버">Bauhaus</a> was founded by architect <strong><u>Walter Gropius</u></strong> in Weimar. It was grounded in the idea of creating a Gesamtkunstwerk ("comprehensive artwork") in which all the arts would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, modernist architecture and art, design, and architectural education.[2] The Bauhaus movement had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design, and typography.[3] Staff at the Bauhaus included prominent artists such as Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, and László Moholy-Nagy at various points.

Although the school was closed, the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they left Germany and emigrated all over the world.[4]
